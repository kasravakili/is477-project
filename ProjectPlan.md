Overview Question:
The overall goal of our project is to analyze how individual player performance metrics translate into overall team success in the NBA. By integrating multiple basketball data sources, we aim to identify which statistical indicators—such as shooting efficiency, assists, rebounds, turnovers, and usage rate—most strongly correlate with team win percentage. Beyond correlation, we seek to develop predictive models capable of estimating a team’s likelihood of winning a game based on both player-level and team-level statistics.

Research Questions: 
1.) Which player performance metrics (field goal percentage, assists, rebounds, turnovers, plus/minus) correlate the most with team success (win percentage)? 
2.) How does player usage rate and efficiency impact overall team performance?
3.) Can we build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a team winning a game based on player and team-level statistics?


Data Set:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball/data

Constraints: 
-Dataset is not up to date to the newest season, additionally, the statistics do not update live. 

Gaps:
-We lack access to the offical NBA live API, which has real time statistics updated after every game. Price is the main constraint behind this. 

Timeline:
Acquire data from at least two sources (API + static dataset) (Jeevan) [Oct 15-18]
• Create file structure in repo 
• Create basic code that reads each dataset. 

Data Cleaning (Kasra) [Oct 20-Nov 1] 
• Clean data (handle missing values & outliers)
• Assess data quality (See if it can help solve our inquries) 
• Create early visualizations and statistical conclusions

Interim Status Report (Kasra + Jeevan) [Nov 3-10]
• Update progress in StatusReport.md
• Include data cleaning results, early findings, and updated timeline

Modeling (Kasra) [Nov 12-24] 
• Build models (regression, classification, or clustering)
• Compare results and test reproducibility

Visualization (Jeevan) [Nov 20-Dec 1] 
• Create final plots, dashboards, and metrics 
• Summarize findings

Final Submission/Completion (Kasra + Jeevan)
• Assemble all scripts and data
• Make sure all code/scripts are functioning properly. 
• Tag GitHub release as “final-project”
