Research Questions: 
1.) Which player performance metrics (field goal percentage, assists, rebounds, turnovers, plus/minus) correlate the most with team success (win percentage)? 
2.) How does player usage rate and efficiency impact overall team performance?
3.) Can we build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a team winning a game based on player and team-level statistics?
